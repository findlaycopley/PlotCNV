Description: This package has been written to create a nice genome wide plot of copynumber segments.
    Currently it's only able to run on hg19 because I'm lazy and have just manually specified these coords. 
    But it should run on any genome once I adjust the setPositionsCNV function to actually get coords from other genomes.
